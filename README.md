# Car Damage Classification

This project aims to classify car damage using machine learning techniques, focusing on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models like MobileNetV2. The goal is to accurately detect and categorize the extent of damage on vehicles.

### Features

•  Data Preprocessing: Scripts for cleaning and augmenting the dataset.

•  Model Training: Implementation of MobileNetV2 and custom CNN models.

•  Evaluation: Tools to measure model performance and accuracy.

•  Deployment: Ready-to-use model for real-world applications.
